# Crowd-Detection
A Python-based AI project that uses a pre-trained object detection model (Faster R-CNN) to detect people in a video and identify crowds based on spatial proximity and time persistence.  A crowd is defined as 3 or more persons standing close to each other for at least 10 consecutive frames.
